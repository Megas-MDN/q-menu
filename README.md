##### Dashboard:

The main dashboard serves as the control center for the restaurant. Managers can monitor and manage all tables and orders in real time. The intuitive interface visually displays table orders, enabling the staff to identify tables that require attention.

##### Table Creation and QR Codes:

Tables can be created and deleted directly from the dashboard. Each table is associated with a unique QR code that customers can scan to access the restaurant's menu on their mobile devices.

##### Interactive Menu:

Through the QR code, customers can access the restaurant's digital menu on their smartphones. This provides a convenient and contactless experience, allowing customers to browse the menu and place orders according to their preferences.

##### Real-time Orders via Socket:

When a customer places an order using the digital menu, order details are instantly sent via socket to the main dashboard. This enables the restaurant staff to track orders in real time and respond to customer needs promptly.

##### Order Tracking and History:

Each order is recorded in the database, ensuring a complete history of customer interactions with the restaurant. This not only assists with inventory and production management but also enables the restaurant to better understand customer preferences and offer personalized service.
